# Sales-Performance-Analysis-for-a-Computer-Hardware-Retailer
Power BI Dashboard designed to analyse Sales Insights of a Computer Hardware Retailer Company.

Designed and deployed an automated Power BI dashboard for a computer hardware retailer with 50+ SKUs and operations across 14 cities, addressing key scalability challenges. Using SQL for data extraction and transformation, I visualized essential KPIs such as revenue growth, YOY trends, and region-wise sales performance over a 12-month period. The dashboard enabled real-time, data-driven decision-making, reducing reporting time by ~60% and projecting a 7% revenue uplift in the upcoming quarter based on actionable insights.
